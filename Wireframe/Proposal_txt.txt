Attached is a copy of the proposal wireframe. I would like to build an ecommerce website that users need to log into in order to view and buy things. A user will then be able to add items to a favorites list and remove. When a user actually purchase something it will be removed from the database.My plan is that there is going to be unique designs that are hand made so you would only be able to buy each item once, but once bought the item would be sold out on the website. The idea for this was created because my wife actually does unique decals, and has being wanting to display her work to sell.
